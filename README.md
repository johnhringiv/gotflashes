# G.O.T. Flashes Challenge Tracker

A web application for tracking Lightning Class sailing activity and managing the G.O.T. Flashes Challenge awards program. This system helps Lightning sailors log their days on the water, track progress toward annual awards, and foster friendly competition within the sailing community.

**G.O.T. Flashes** stands for "**Get Out There** - FLASHES" - encouraging Lightning sailors to get their boats off the dock and onto the water!

**🌐 Live Application**: [https://gotflashes.com](https://gotflashes.com)

## About the G.O.T. Flashes Challenge

The G.O.T. Flashes Challenge encourages Lightning Class sailors to get on the water more frequently by recognizing their annual sailing activity. Participants earn awards at 10, 25, and 50+ days, with the simple goal: **Get the boat off the dock!**

### What Counts
- **Sailing Days**: Any time spent sailing on a Lightning (as skipper or crew) - unlimited
- **Non-Sailing Days**: Up to 5 days per year for boat/trailer maintenance or race committee work

### Award Tiers
- **10 Days**: First tier recognition
- **25 Days**: Second tier recognition
- **50+ Days**: Third tier recognition (including Burgee eligibility)

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- PHP 8.2 or higher
- Composer
- Node.js & NPM
- SQLite

### Quick Setup

1. **Clone the repository**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/johnhringiv/gotflashes.git
   cd gotflashes
   ```

2. **Install dependencies and setup**
   ```bash
   composer setup
   ```
   This command will:
   - Install PHP dependencies
   - Copy `.env.example` to `.env`
   - Generate application key
   - Run database migrations
   - Install Node dependencies
   - Build frontend assets

3. **Start development server**
   ```bash
   composer dev
   ```
   This runs multiple services concurrently:
   - Laravel development server (http://localhost:8000)
   - Queue worker
   - Log viewer (Pail)
   - Vite dev server for hot module reload

4. **Access the application**
   Open http://localhost:8000 in your browser

### Creating Admin Users

After setup, you'll need to create at least one admin user to access the award fulfillment dashboard:

```bash
php artisan tinker
```

Then in the Tinker REPL:
```php
$user = User::where('email', 'user@example.com')->first();
$user->is_admin = true;
$user->save();
```

Press `Ctrl+C` to exit Tinker.

**Security Note:** Only grant admin access to trusted users. Admins can:
- View all user addresses and contact information
- Manage award fulfillment records across all users
- Export user data via CSV (includes personal information)
- Access the award fulfillment dashboard

### Docker Deployment

For production deployment using Docker (no PHP/Node required on host):

```bash
# 1. Configure environment
cp .env.docker .env
# Edit .env and set APP_KEY

# 2. Build and run
mkdir -p database storage/app storage/logs
docker build -t gotflashes:latest .
docker run -d --name gotflashes --restart unless-stopped \
  -p 8080:80 \
  -v $(pwd)/database:/var/www/html/database \
  -v $(pwd)/storage/app:/var/www/html/storage/app \
  -v $(pwd)/storage/logs:/var/www/html/storage/logs \
  --env-file .env \
  gotflashes:latest
```

### Code Quality & Linting

This project uses multiple linters and automated tests to maintain code quality. Three simple commands handle everything:

```bash
# Check all code (linting + tests)
composer check

# Run tests only
composer test

# Auto-fix code style issues
composer fix
```

#### What Gets Checked

**`composer check`** runs:
- **Laravel Pint** - PHP code formatting (PSR-12)
- **PHPStan** - PHP static analysis (type safety, bug detection)
- **ESLint** - JavaScript linting
- **Stylelint** - CSS linting
- **PHPUnit** - PHP test suite
- **Vitest** - JavaScript test suite (via npm test)

**`composer fix`** runs:
- **Laravel Pint** - Auto-fixes PHP formatting
- **ESLint** - Auto-fixes JavaScript issues
- **Stylelint** - Auto-fixes CSS issues

#### Pre-commit Hooks

This project uses Husky to automatically run code quality checks before each commit. When you commit, `composer check` runs automatically, which includes:
- Laravel Pint (PHP formatting)
- PHPStan (PHP static analysis)
- ESLint (JavaScript linting)
- Stylelint (CSS linting)
- PHPUnit (test suite)

If any check fails, the commit will be blocked until you run `composer fix` and fix any remaining issues.

## Documentation

- **[Product Requirements](docs/prd.md)**: Detailed feature specifications and business rules
- **[Membership Year-End Logic](docs/membership-year-end-logic.md)**: Year-specific membership system documentation
- **[Contributing](docs/CONTRIBUTING.md)**: Guidelines for contributing to the project

## Configuration

### Environment Variables

**Required (must be set manually):**
- `APP_KEY` - Application encryption key (auto-generated by `php artisan key:generate`)

**Commonly Modified:**
- `APP_ENV` - Environment: `local`, `staging`, or `production`
- `APP_DEBUG` - Debug mode: `true` for development, `false` for production
- `APP_URL` - Your application URL (e.g., `https://gotflashes.com`)
- `BASIC_AUTH_USERNAME` / `BASIC_AUTH_PASSWORD` - Optional HTTP Basic Auth for staging protection

**Observability (optional tuning):**
- `LOG_SLOW_QUERIES` - Log database queries exceeding threshold (default: enabled)
- `SLOW_QUERY_THRESHOLD_MS` - Slow query threshold in milliseconds (default: 100ms)
- `SLOW_REQUEST_THRESHOLD_MS` - Slow HTTP request threshold in milliseconds (default: 300ms)

**Default Configuration:**
- **Local Development**: See `.env.example` for all available options and defaults
- **Production**: See `docker/.env.docker` for production-optimized defaults

### Observability Features

The application includes comprehensive logging and monitoring:

- **Request Logging**: All HTTP requests with structured context (request ID, user, duration, memory)
- **Livewire Tracking**: Automatic component interaction logging (method calls, property updates)
- **Performance Monitoring**: Slow query and slow request detection (configurable thresholds)
- **Security Auditing**: Authentication events and admin actions logged to dedicated channels
- **Error Tracking**: Exceptions logged with full context (user, request, stack trace)

**Log Channels:**
- `structured` - All requests/responses with JSON context
- `security` - Authentication and authorization events
- `performance` - Slow query/request warnings
- `admin` - Admin action audit trail

Logs are written to `storage/logs/`. During development, view real-time logs with `php artisan pail`.

## Production Deployment

### Docker Deployment

**Required Setup:**
1. Set `APP_KEY` in your environment (generate with `php artisan key:generate`)
2. Mount persistent storage paths:
   - `/var/www/html/storage/logs` - Application logs
   - `/var/www/html/database/database.sqlite` - Database file

**Production defaults** are pre-configured in `docker/.env.docker`. Only override when needed.

### Deployment Stack

- **Cloudflare**: DNS and CDN (firewall restricts traffic to Cloudflare IPs only)
- **ACME/Let's Encrypt**: SSL certificate management
- **HAProxy**: SSL termination and reverse proxy
- **Docker Container**: Application (nginx + PHP-FPM + Supervisor)

**Security Note:** Firewall-level restrictions ensure only Cloudflare IPs can reach the server, allowing nginx to safely trust `X-Forwarded-For` headers for real client IP logging.

See this [guide](https://johnhringiv.com/secure-scalable-home-web-hosting) for the full deployment setup.
