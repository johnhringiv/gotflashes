# G.O.T. Flashes Challenge Tracker
## Product Requirements Document

### Executive Summary
A standalone web-based application to replace the current web form for tracking participant days sailing Lightnings as part of the G.O.T. Flashes Challenge. The system tracks annual sailing activity and automatically identifies award eligibility (10, 25, or 50+ days), with the goal of encouraging Lightning sailors to get on the water more frequently and creating friendly competition within fleets and districts.

## 1. User Management

### 1.1 User Registration
New users create accounts with the following information:

**Required Fields:**
- Email address (unique username/identifier)
- Password
- First name and last name
- Date of birth (for demographics tracking, especially sailors under 32)

- Automatic carry-forward from previous years when not updated
- Unaffiliated sailors supported (no district or fleet required)

*For detailed membership logic, see [membership-year-end-logic.md](membership-year-end-logic.md).*

**Note**: Users don't need to own a Lightning - crews and anyone who sails on Lightnings can participate.

## 2. Awards & Recognition System

### 2.1 Program Rules - What Counts
The following activities count toward G.O.T. Flashes awards:

**Sailing Days:**
- Any time spent sailing on ANY Lightning (not just your own boat)
- Counts whether you're the skipper or crew
- Goal: Get the boat off the dock!
- **Unlimited**: Sailing days always count toward awards

**Non-Sailing Days:**
The following activities may count toward your annual total:
- Lightning boat maintenance
- Lightning trailer maintenance
- On-the-water Race Committee work on days where Lightnings are racing
- **Limitation**: Maximum 5 non-sailing days per calendar year count toward awards
- Users can log unlimited non-sailing days, but only the first 5 count toward award totals
- Counter resets January 1st each year

**Award Calculation:**
- **Qualifying Days** = Sailing Days + Logged Non-Sailing Days (up to 5 per year)
- All logged activities count toward awards (system prevents logging ineligible activities)
- Awards are based on calendar year (January 1 - December 31)

**Date Restrictions:**
- No future dates allowed (tolerance: +1 day for timezone handling)
- One activity per date per user (duplicate prevention enforced)
- Activities must be logged by January 31st of the following year (grace period deadline)

**Grace Period & Editability:**
- **During January**: Can log/edit/delete both current year and previous year activities
- **Starting February 1st**: Previous year becomes read-only (view only)
- **Current year**: Always editable/deletable until grace period ends (following January 31st)
- Grace period allows one month to finalize previous year's activities before they're locked

### 2.2 Award Tiers
Participants earn recognition at the following annual milestones:
- **10 days**: First tier award (badge image: `got-10-badge.png`)
- **25 days**: Second tier award (badge image: `got-25-badge.png`)
- **50+ days**: Third tier award (badge image: `got-50-badge.png`, including Burgee eligibility with burgee image: `burgee-50.jpg`)

**Award Badge Display:**
- Award badges are displayed as images, not text labels
- Award badges are displayed cumulatively - earning a higher tier shows all lower tier badges
- Example: A user with 50 days sees all three badge images (10-day, 25-day, and 50-day)
- Badges only appear once the threshold is met (no empty/placeholder badges shown below thresholds)
- At exactly 10, 25, or 50 days, the respective badge image appears immediately
- The 50-day award includes special "(Burgee)" designation in the display text
